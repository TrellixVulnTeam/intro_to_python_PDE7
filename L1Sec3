'''
This is for intro to functions, the objectives are the following: 
1. Why would we use functions? 
2. What does return do?
3. How do we pass in parameters?

### Version 1

city = input("enter a city")
temperature = input("what is the temperature today?")
print("It is " + str(temperature) + " in " + city + " today.")

city = input("enter a city")
temperature = input("what is the temperature today?")
print("It is " + str(temperature) + " in " + city + " today.")

city = input("enter a city")
temperature = input("what is the temperature today?")
print("It is " + str(temperature) + " in " + city + " today.")







### Version 2

def announcer():
    city = input("enter a city")
    temperature = input("what is the temperature today?")
    print("It is " + str(temperature) + " in " + city + " today.")
    

announcer()
announcer()
announcer()
print(announcer())  #what happens here







### Version 3

def announcer_with_return():
    city = input("enter a city")
    temperature = input("what is the temperature today?")
    print("It is " + str(temperature) + " in " + city + " today.")
    return "It is " + str(temperature) + " in " + city + " today."
    
    
print(announcer())
